Fantasy Football Front Office is the legitimate face of an epic fantasy football empire. Founded in 2010 by 12 billionaires obsessed with fantasy footbal, the League started with spreadsheets and dreams. Eventually, they put their big boy pants on and built themselves a web app to manage teams and player contracts. It lives in perpetuity as the best fantasy football league on the face of the planet.
